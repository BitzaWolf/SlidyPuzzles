# Slidy Puzzles

This is a simple game written entirely by myself in native Java 1.5.

The game replciates those toy puzzles where you're given a scrambled image and you need to slide tiles around to reform the original image.

Slidy Puzzles comes with its own set of images, but you can use any image on your computer. Every puzzle has a solution.

# Run

Download Slidy Puzzles.jar and run it - `java -jar 'Slidy Puzzles.jar'`. You can also double-click it.
